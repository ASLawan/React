# Introduction to REACT

Learing react by building projects

## ToDoApp

Started learning by building this basic todoapp. Through the app i have understood the fundamentals and have also seen why **React** is such a big name in the industry.

So far I believe i was able to grasp the concepts from this first app thanks to a good understanding of:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## The App

- A basic todo app implemented as **SPA** with form to allow you create a todo list.
- You can mark todo items as completed
- You can delete completed items
- The app keeps track of total todos as well as completed ones

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React framework

It's amazing how all of this happens within the browser alone.
